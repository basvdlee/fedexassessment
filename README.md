# FedexAssessment by Bas van der Lee

I am looking forward to the feedback :)

## How to

Run `npm i` to install dependencies.  
Run `npm run start` to serve the application locally.  
Run `npm run test` to run the unit tests.  

## Choices

I saw the use of **Material** and **Tailwindcss** by you so that's why I gone with It aswell.  
**Jest:** I wanted to try the new support by Angular  
**Spectator:** Makes testing just a bit easier, which result in more tests
